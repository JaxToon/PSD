The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it's exactly what's going to happen), the events don't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don't make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it's hilarious, you can't help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.I never saw any of the \"Shades of Gray\" movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I'm still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.The good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me):\nthe photography is pretty good, at least the cinematographer knew what he was doingthe actors are generally pretty easy on the eye, the costumes are also solid, there are nice and diverse locations, hence there is always something appealing to look at on the screenthe sex scenes are pretty good if you're into that kind of thing (I am)Should you see it? Well I don't know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone's else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.So yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low.",

            "full_review": "I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like \"woo lets go buy some new clothes\". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like \"oh that's good she got away from him\". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like \"Yeah fair enough\" and just sits down like this happens every day.On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like \"Posing, modelling\" faces and is not like \"Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help\". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?It also relies heavily on \"Pop\" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like \"well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in\".I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.So its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck.",

            "full_review": "A mobster has a woman he's never met kidnapped and when she awakens from the drug given to knock her out, he informs her that she'll be living as his prisoner for 365 days. If after this period she hasn't fallen in love with him, he says he'll let her go. And, this weird rape fantasy ends up proving that in the end that the woman DOES want to be dominated, abused and forced to be a sex slave because the man is so sexy hot.I honestly think that the folks responsible for \"365 Days\" know they created an evil and dangerous film....and that was their intention. Sure, it's irresponsible to make a movie promoting kidnapping and sexual assault...and I cannot imagine any normal person thinking this is a good thing or that it would make a good movie. No, I think the filmmakers knew the film would get a lot of hate and anger...and as a result, it would get a lot of attention. In other words, if you can't make a good film to get attention, make a terrible one to get attention. And, not surprisingly, this film has earned a spot on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List.So is the film good in any way? The plot that is pro-rape and pro-kidnapping certainly isn't good. Technically speaking, the film also has a few issues.....though it is slick and 'hip' much of the time. While they do a lot of gimmicky cinematographic techniques to make the movie look good, it also often falls back on the tired use of the shaky cam. Additionally, the film turns out to be disappointing even as pornography, as you really don't get much enjoyment or sexual energy from most of the picture. You'd do much better just looking at porn online or just making consensual love with your own partner! Overall, a smarmy little picture...one that unfortunately DID get the negative attention they filmmakers wanted but which also contributes nothing positive to this world and is rather boring.In real life, I am trying to imagine an offender in court telling the judge \"I was just doing what I saw them doing in \"365 Days\"...is that so wrong?!\"....and promptly being sentenced to 104 years in prison!",

She literally falls in the ocean because of HIM and she thinks hes some prince charming. NO. It was his fault. He literally saved you from a situation HE put you in. We all have our fantasies but Netflix should not bring such vile images to my screen. I have issues and these issues have been AMPLIFIED by this absolute snuff film.",

            "full_review": "Is this a 5-star flick? No. But it's not supposed to be. I'm really surprised by the number of bad reviews. It's basically a soft-core porn as everyone has said. Kind of a plot, but not really. More of a erotic fantasy. I love the 2 main characters together. They seemed to have great chemistry. It works. I speak for myself here, but I don't really like regular porn as it's very unrealistic. Yes as a female I will watch some of it, but I don't get turned on to the same things men do and I'm always searching for something that I really enjoy watching that doesn't annoy me with the whiny moans and money shots. At least something like this is a little more relatable and not so ridiculously fake (very little based on the \"plot\" but you know what I mean). It's a steamy fantasy movie. That's it. I read all 50 shades books and the movies were really awful. I was so disappointed. They should've gone all out. This movie, the sex scenes, especially the first one, were on point! As a chick, I'm into the erotic steamy sex scenes in movies and they're hard to find. Those turn me on more than porn. I like to see passion, love, sweat, etc. This movie shows that. I hope they plan to do the others in the series, which based on the ending, it appears they will since it's left open.",

            "full_review": "The plot was loosely constructed filler for the scenes in between the porn. It was like 50 shades of grey meets, pornhub meets polish twilight meets general hospital. The dialogue was surface level and cringy. Nothing was remotely convincing and the world building was weak at best. The whole film seems like fan fiction put on screen. The only good thing about this film was the lighting and use of color. Everything else was sub par at best. Not to mention the problematic subject matter and sexist undertones. If you wanna a better film with sexual tension I'd recommend call me by your name or In the mood for love, don't give this film your time.",
